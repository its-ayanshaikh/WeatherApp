# WeatherApp
 Created a dynamic Django-based Weather App that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can view weather conditions for cities worldwide and toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The project combines Python for back-end logic and JavaScript for front-end interactivity, offering an engaging user experience.
